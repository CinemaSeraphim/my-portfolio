                            A Crest Secondary School project where we learn to create a functional machine that
                            interacts dynamically with its environment. As such, throughout the whole project, we
                            obtained and
                            learned knowledge and skills on programming alongside robotics.

                            Taking place in 2023, this ITE-funded project was an event where many different secondary schools were required to create a group comprising of around 3-4
                            students, which in turn are guided by their lecturers in order to create and showcase the work they've put into a project the ITE campus has assigned them with.
                            <br><br>
                            I was one of the few that had been selected by my teachers to work in a group of 3 to create a project related to Robotics and smart systems. Our assignment was to
                            create and program a functional robotics machine that is able to dynamically interact with its environment and respond to changes.
                            <br><br>
                            Due to the nature of the assignment, our group was tasked with learning how to program and code, as well as research how to manage mechanics and automated systems.
